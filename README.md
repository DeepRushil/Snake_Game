# 🐍 Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake game built using Python and the built-in `turtle` module.  
The player controls the snake using the arrow keys, eats food to grow longer, and must avoid hitting the walls or the snake’s own body.

This project is beginner-friendly and was created for learning Python basics like loops, functions, conditions, and simple game logic.
